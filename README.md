## Rack-Level Power for an Off-Grid Data Center 

![OGDC Logo](../media/data-center-logo.png)

As a ChemE undergrad at the University of Washingon, my final thesis was to develop, from the ground up, off-grid data center along with a team of other students.

We chose to power our data center with a natural gas source, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, which not only release low emissions but have a high electric yield. 

In this repository, you will find our final report and final presentation we presented to a panel of mock stakeholders, which contains the following: 
- Development Processes
- Technical Specifications
- Mass/Energy Balances
- Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) 
- Economic Analysis 
- Optimization Techniques 

As an interesting factoid, we came up with our logo after bonding over our mutual love of Spumoni (..the craving is real..)

With that, I leave you to peruse the documentation - have fun! 

Best, 
Sesha

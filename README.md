## Rack-Level Power for an Off-Grid Data Center 

![OGDC Logo](/media/data-center-logo.png)

As a ChemE undergrad at the University of Washingon, my final thesis was to develop from the ground-up an off-grid data center with a team of other students. 

We chose to go with an off-grid, natural gas source used to power Solid Oxide Fuel Cells to produce the electricity for our data center, as this power source not only releases low emissions but has a high electric yield. 

In this repository, you will find our final report and final presentation we presented to a panel of mock stakeholders, which contains the following: 
- Development Processes
- Technical Specifications
- Mass/Energy Balances
- Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) 
- Economic Analysis 
- Optimization Techniques 

By doing this, we were able to design a 3000 SOFC, 150-MW data center that has been proven to break even with traditional on-grid power sources in 10 years of implementation while additionally developing a plan to make 10% profit over 10 years.

As an interesting factoid, we came up with our logo after bonding over our mutual love of Spumoni (..the craving is real..)

With that, I leave you to peruse the documentation - have fun! 

Cheers,
